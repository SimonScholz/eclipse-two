# Eclipse Two

The real next-generation Eclipse IDE based on Electron.

The philosophy is to treat the IDE as a web-site which has access to local resources and tools as well as cloud based services.
It brings a new user experience to the desktop IDE that is friendly, integrated, and powerful.
The user starts with a dashboard of cards supplied by plug-ins that give the developer access to all the information they need to
do their jobs. From there, the IDE helps the user through working with code, checking that code into source control,
integrating changes with change management systems like JIRA or bugzilla, provides a user interface to cloud services like logs
allowing the developer to associate code changes with cloud resources.

The foundation is Electron which provides an HTML5 user interface with a node.js backend. Plug-ins will be dynamically loaded as
required and can launch and integrate with microservices. The Language Server Protocol will be a key part of this, as will protocols
that integrate other tools.

It's a platform that will serve us well for the next 20 years as Eclipse One has done for the last 20 years.
